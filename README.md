Ian Klosowicz is hosting a dashboard contest: https://iklosowicz.gumroad.com/l/aliens-in-america.
He made available 3 fictitious datasets about aliens living amongst humans in USA. These datasets need to be cleaned and reported back in a dashboard.

I decided to manipulate and clean the data using mysql. Then I used Tableau to create a dashboard that is available at: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pedro.souto.ourem/viz/Alien_16619095193220/alien_dashboard?publish=yes.
